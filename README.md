# Strings and Numbers
## Instructions
- **Work in the file `solution.js`**

## 1. Concatenation
* Create two variables `introSentence` and `age`. The first variable should contain a string value and the second should contain a number. Concatenate the string and the number and log it to the console.
```javascript
let introSentence = "hello, my name is Fran and I am";
let age = 25;
```

**Expected Output**: 
```javascript
"hello, my name is Fran and I am 25"
```
* In this case, what is the `+` operator doing? Comment your answer in the js file.

## 2. Converting 
* Create a variable named `integer` and assign the string value of "1005" (including quotes). Convert it to a number and log it to the console.
* Create a variable named `float` and assign the string value of "10.05" (including quotes). Convert it to a number and log it to the console.
